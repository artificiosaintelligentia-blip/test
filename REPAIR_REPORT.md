# TopMediumVisie Repair Report

## Summary
Successfully restored SSR functionality and added dynamic features while maintaining existing UX/IA.

## Changes Made

### A) Next.js Configuration
- ✅ Removed `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js`
- ✅ Removed `images: { unoptimized: true }` to restore image optimization
- ✅ Restored default SSR behavior for Vercel deployment

### B) Layout & Error Handling
- ✅ Added `app/error.tsx` as client component with error/reset props
- ✅ Added `app/not-found.tsx` for 404 handling
- ✅ Added `app/global-error.tsx` for critical error handling
- ✅ Layout remains clean with no data fetching or notFound() calls

### C) Authentication System
- ✅ Implemented NextAuth with Prisma adapter
- ✅ Email provider always enabled
- ✅ Google/Apple OAuth only enabled when both ID and SECRET exist
- ✅ Graceful degradation when OAuth envs are missing
- ✅ Auth API route at `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

### D) Stripe Integration
- ✅ Checkout API route with `runtime: 'nodejs'` and `dynamic: 'force-dynamic'`
- ✅ Webhook handler using raw body parsing
- ✅ Transaction creation and wallet balance updates on successful payments
- ✅ 503 responses when Stripe envs are missing
- ✅ UI gracefully hides wallet features when Stripe unavailable

### E) Database & Prisma
- ✅ Complete Prisma schema with all required models
- ✅ Singleton Prisma client to prevent dev leaks
- ✅ Proper relationships and constraints
- ✅ Cents-based pricing for accuracy

### F) Seeding System
- ✅ Idempotent seed script using upsert operations
- ✅ Seeds specialties, users, consultants, and blog posts
- ✅ Database check endpoint at `/internal/db-check`
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/internal/health`

### G) Testing & Scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive smoke test script
- ✅ Tests core routes and conditional Stripe functionality
- ✅ Package.json scripts for typecheck, build, seed, smoketest
- ✅ Environment example file with clear documentation

## Key Features
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works with missing environment variables
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper types
- **Production Ready**: SSR enabled, proper error handling, security considerations
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns, reusable components
- **Testable**: Smoke tests ensure core functionality works

## Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (required)
- Email server settings (required for auth)
- OAuth credentials (optional - features disabled if missing)
- Stripe keys (optional - wallet features disabled if missing)

## Next Steps
1. Set up environment variables
2. Run database migrations: `npm run seed`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`
4. Run smoke tests: `npm run smoketest`

The application now supports full SSR with dynamic features while maintaining the original UX/IA design.
